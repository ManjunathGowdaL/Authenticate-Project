# Installing and Using Playwright for Frontend Automation

## Step 1: Install Node.js and npm

Download and install Node.js from the [official website](https://nodejs.org/). This will also install npm (Node Package Manager).

## Step 2: Install Visual Studio Code (VS Code)

Download and install VS Code from the [official website](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

## Step 3: Setup Playwright

1. Open VS Code and create a new directory for your project.
2. Open the terminal in VS Code (`Ctrl + ``) and navigate to your project directory.
3. Initialize a new npm project:

    ```bash
    npm init -y
    ```

4. Install Playwright and the required dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install playwright
    ```

## Step 4: Write Your Playwright Script

Create a new JavaScript file in your project directory, e.g., `test_script.js`. Write your automation script. Here's an example for searching products:

    ```javascript
    const { chromium } = require('playwright');

    (async () => {
        const browser = await chromium.launch();
        const page = await browser.newPage();
        await page.goto('https://www.example.com');
        await page.fill('input[name="q"]', 'product name');
        await page.click('button[type="submit"]');
        // Add more actions and assertions as needed
        await browser.close();
    })();
    ```

## Step 5: Run Your Script

Execute the script from the terminal:

    ```bash
    node test_script.js
    ```

## Step 6: Generate Reports

Integrate reporting libraries if needed, or manually log results as required.

# Installing and Using Postman for Backend API Automation

## Step 1: Install Postman

Download and install Postman from the [official website](https://www.postman.com/downloads/).

## Step 2: Import APIs into Postman

1. Open Postman and click on **"Import"** to add your API collections.
2. Choose the file (e.g., `Authenticate Mock API postman_collection.json`) and click **"Import."**

## Step 3: Create and Execute Test Cases

Open the imported collection. Add test scripts in the **"Tests"** tab for each API request. Example test script:

    ```javascript
    pm.test("Status code is 200", function () {
        pm.response.to.have.status(200);
    });
    ```

## Step 4: Chain APIs

Use the `pm.sendRequest` function to make additional API calls based on previous responses.

## Step 5: Generate Reports

Use Postman's built-in reporting features or integrate with tools like Newman for command-line execution and reporting:

    ```bash
    npm install -g newman
    newman run your_collection.json -r html,cli
    ```
